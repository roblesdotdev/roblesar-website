# About Me

I'm a full-stack developer based in Tinogasta, Catamarca, Argentina. I graduated
as a systems analyst in 2017 and have a deep passion for programming. I find
great satisfaction in taking an idea from concept to execution, transforming
complex challenges into streamlined, effective solutions.

My journey in web development started several years ago, and since then, I've
dedicated myself to mastering various programming languages and frameworks, with
a strong focus on web technologies. I thrive on creating dynamic, responsive web
applications and take pride in every stage of the development process.

## Skills

I enjoy building things with modern tools like Astro, React, Remix and
Typescript. I rely on Prisma for database management and Hono for creating fast
and efficient APIs. My preferred databases are SQLite, ideal for lightweight and
embedded projects, and Postgres, which provides robustness and scalability for
larger applications.
